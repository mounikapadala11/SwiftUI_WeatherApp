# My First SwiftUI Page

## Key Takeaways

- **Extracting Sub-Views**
  - Sub-views can be extracted for reusability and better organization of the SwiftUI code.

- **ZStack Limitation**
  - The main `ZStack` in SwiftUI can hold a maximum of 11 elements, including stacks, spacers, and other UI elements.

- **Reusable Components**
  - Elements commonly used across different pages can be saved in separate files for better modularity and reuse in the SwiftUI project.
